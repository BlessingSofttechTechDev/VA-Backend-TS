🚀 _Tech Stack Setup Complete!_

Hey team! 👋

We've set up our production-grade Next.js application. Here's what we're using and why:

_Core Framework:_
• Next.js 16 (App Router) - Latest version for optimal performance, server components, and API routes
• TypeScript - Type safety, better DX, catches errors at compile time
• React 19 - Latest features and performance improvements

_Styling & UI:_
• Tailwind CSS v4 - Utility-first CSS, rapid development, consistent design system
• shadcn/ui - High-quality, accessible components built on Radix UI
• Headless UI - Unstyled, accessible components for complex UI patterns
• Lucide React + Heroicons - Modern icon libraries

_State Management:_
• Zustand - Lightweight, simple API, perfect for our scale. No boilerplate like Redux

_API & Data:_
• Axios - Robust HTTP client with interceptors for auth, error handling
• Zod - Runtime type validation, ensures data integrity from APIs

_Code Quality:_
• ESLint + TypeScript ESLint - Catches bugs, enforces best practices, type safety
• Prettier - Consistent code formatting across the team
• Strict TypeScript config - No `any` types, unused variables caught

_Architecture:_
• Scalable folder structure (components, lib, store, types, config)
• Absolute imports (@/ alias) - Cleaner imports
• Environment validation - Prevents runtime config errors
• Middleware setup - Security headers, request handling

_Why these choices?_
✅ Production-ready from day one
✅ Scalable architecture for long-term growth
✅ Type safety reduces bugs
✅ Modern tooling = faster development
✅ Industry-standard libraries

Would love your feedback and suggestions! 🙌
